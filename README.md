# DrugDiscovery

This project is my attempt to discover novel drugs for Covid using GAN model i.e. Generative Adversarial Networks. I built, optimized and trained the model to some extent. The work had to be halted midway as job responsibilites changed. However, I did learn about GANs in general. The work is done using PyTorch.
